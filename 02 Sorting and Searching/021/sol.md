### Question
#### Apartments
There are n applicants and m free apartments. Your task is to distribute the apartments so that as many applicants as possible will get an apartment.
Each applicant has a desired apartment size, and they will accept any apartment whose size is close enough to the desired size.

Input: The first input line has three integers $ n, m $ and $ k $  the number of applicants, the number of apartments, and the maximum allowed difference.
The next line contains n integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ the desired apartment size of each applicant. If the desired size of an applicant is $ x $, they will accept any apartment whose size is between $ x-k $ and $ x+k $.
The last line contains $ m $ integers $ b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m $ the size of each apartment.

Output: The number of applicants who will get an apartment.

**Constraints**

$$ 1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $$
$$ 0 \le k \le 10^9 $$
$$ 1 \le a_i, b_i \le 10^9 $$

**Example**
- Input: 4, 3, 5, [60, 45, 80, 60], [30, 60, 75]
- Output: 2
