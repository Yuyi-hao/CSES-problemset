### Question
#### Collecting Numbers II
You are given an array that contains each number between $1 \dots n$ exactly once. Your task is to collect the numbers from $1$ to $n$ in increasing order.
On each round, you go through the array from left to right and collect as many numbers as possible.
Given $m$ operations that swap two numbers in the array, your task is to report the number of rounds after each operation.

**Input**
- The first line has two integers $n$ and $m$: the array size and the number of operations.
- The next line has $n$ integers $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$: the numbers in the array.
- Finally, there are $m$ lines that describe the operations. Each line has two integers $a$ and $b$: the numbers at positions $a$ and $b$ are swapped.

**Output**
- Print m integers: the number of rounds after each swap.

**Constraints**
$$ 1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $$
$$ 1 \le a,b \le n $$


**Example**
- Input: 5, 3, [4, 2, 1, 5, 3], [[2, 3], [1, 5], [2, 3]]
- Output: [2, 3, 4]
